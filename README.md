Everything is computed only in your browser. Nothing ever leaves your machine, or even your browser tab. There is no database, no server-side code. Everything vanishes when you close your tab.

Do NOT use the generated keypairs/addresses to hold large amounts of personal digital assets. This web app has not been audited. Use only for experimental and educational purposes.
